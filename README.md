### ETS2 Telemetry Web Server Gearbox and gas pedal skins 
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Hiro
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Eurotruck simulatior 2 and the following are some skins I have created based on the https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server

### Background

Telemetry Web Server for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator is written by Funbits. The client side consists of a skinnable HTML5 mobile dashboard application that works in any modern desktop or mobile browser. Android users may also use provided native Android application. 
It can also be used for OBS streaming. This skin aims to provide a gerabox shift pattern and gas pedals status bars so that users can show their gears, gas, brake and clutch levels on the screen
